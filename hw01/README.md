# HW1 Image classification

## Task
- Inputs  
RGB images  
Training / Validation: 21,024; Test: 2,344
- Target  
Corresponding object category id of the image  
100 categories
- Additional Requirements / Limitations  
No external data (i.e., data from other sources) allowed.  
Model size (#parameters) should less than 100M.  
Also, you can only use ResNet (e.g., ResNet18/34/â€¦) as the model backbone in this task. Modification to the backbone is allowed.   
Not a requirement: pretrained weights is allowed.
